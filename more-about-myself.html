    <p id="p2">Classically trained musician who enjoys 
        teaching as a way of constant learning, whether
        it is an instrument like drums or guitar, or a
        language like English or Spanish.
        Curious and analytical, often finding the 
        connections and similarities that link various
        subjects and that make life a little easier to
        understand.</p>
